this is literally a batch file that makes it so you dont have to enter some mumbo jumbo into the command prompt
use steamdb.info to get the build info

step 1. enter your steam username and password into the batch (this is only used for depotdownloader i dont collect this) and search up your game on steamdb.info)
step 2. copy the app id you see and paste into batch
step 3. go to depots and copy the depot id you see and paste into batch
step 4. go to the depot you wanna download
step 5. find the build you want in the manifests part and copy the manifest id from the LIST and not the one where you click on
step 6. paste into batch and wait for the game to download
optional step if the game is launching the latest version: make a file in the same directory as the exe called "steam_appid.txt" and add only the app id inside
